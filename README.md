# NLP Homework Project: Sarcasm Detection in Headlines


Welcome to the NLP Homework Project on Sarcasm Detection in Headlines! In this project, we will explore the fascinating field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by tackling the challenge of determining whether a given news headline is sarcastic or not. We will be using a Kaggle dataset to train and evaluate our model's performance.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a news headline is sarcastic or not. Sarcasm detection is a challenging NLP task, as it requires understanding subtle linguistic cues and context.

**Dataset:** We will utilize the "Sarcasm Detection" dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains news headlines labeled as sarcastic or non-sarcastic, providing us with the necessary training and testing data.

**Tools and Libraries:** To accomplish our goal, we will make use of the Python programming language along with popular NLP libraries such as `NLTK` and `spaCy`. We will also employ machine learning framework `scikit-learn` to develop and evaluate our models.
